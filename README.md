# go.syl.dev

A simple URL shortener akin to [go.gov.sg](https://go.gov.sg/) written in [Gleam](https://gleam.run/)!

## Usage

You may visit [go.sylfr.dev/dashboard](https://go.sylfr.dev/dashboard) to see the frontend, but you will not be able to access it as this is meant for personal use.

If you would like to use this project for yourself, please fork this project and self-host the image anywhere Gleam/BEAM/Erlang will run.

If you intend on hosting on Fly, please ensure that your `fly.toml` file is re-generated using the CLI, or it will not deploy as you will not have the appropriate deploy token for the project.
